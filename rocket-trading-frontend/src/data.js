        question: "What is Options Trading?",
        answer: "Instead of trading stocks, which is one share, we are trading options. An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy(in the case of a call) or sell(in the case of a put) the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date. The options contract is equivalent to 100 shares of a stock but you are trading them at a discounted price. This could lead to potential gains or losses, so enter at your own risk."
